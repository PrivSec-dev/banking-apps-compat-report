# Introduction

A crowd-sourced project dataset for [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) users on [supported devices](https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices), featuring a maintained compatibility [list of tested international banking apps](https://privsec.dev/posts/android/banking-applications-compatibility-with-grapheneos/#international-banking-apps), which is [reviewed](https://github.com/PrivSec-dev/banking-apps-compat-report/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and [published](https://privsec.dev/banking). 

[PrivSec.dev](https://privsec.dev) hosts this 3rd-party community-sourced effort, offering detailed information and which [workarounds](https://akc3n.page/posts/banking-app-issues/) may be required for banking apps compatibility with GrapheneOS.
